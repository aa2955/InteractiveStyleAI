# InteractiveStyleAI
This project applies artistic styles to nature photos using a pre-trained style-transfer model. Users can interactively adjust parameters like color intensity to create personalized artistic renditions. The final app will include an interface with sliders for real-time adjustments and a gallery for transformed images.
